# Web Dev Starter Code Lab 2

## Overview

The purpose of this lab is to enhance our understanding of HTML by tasking us with converting plain text into a well-structured document using HTML markup. The key HTML concepts such as elements, tags, and attributes were applied to ensure that the content is both semantically correct and visually organized. The goal is to take raw text and turn it into a fully structured web page by adding headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and other essential HTML elements, thus reinforcing our comprehension of how HTML forms the basis of web content.

The webpage can be run using the VSCode plugin "Live Preview" to view it on its development server.
